# LONDON-FIRE-BRIGADE
**Kingston Upon Thames Data Mining Project**

**Overview**
This project analyzes a dataset from the London Borough of Kingston Upon Thames, focusing on incidents reported by the London Fire Brigade (LFB) from 2019 to 2022. The goal is to extract actionable insights using data mining techniques, following the CRISP-DM methodology.

**Objectives**
The project aims to address key business concerns for the LFB, including:

1- False Alarms: Identify patterns in false alarms and resource wastage.
2- Fire Severity: Determine factors that increase the likelihood of fires becoming secondary.
3- Response Delays: Analyze how location impacts the response time of the first pump.
4- Emergency Prioritization: Predict incident groups to prioritize emergency responses.
5- Cost Impact: Assess how response times of multiple pump stations affect incident costs.

**Data Mining Techniques Used**
Heatmaps & K-Mean Clustering: For analyzing false alarms and response delays.
Association Analysis: To study fire severity.
Logistic Regression: For predicting incident groups.
Scatter Plots: For visualizing response time delays.

**Project Structure**
File till Preprocessing: Contains initial data preparation and the first three steps of the CRISP-DM process.
Business Questions Files: Includes modeling and analysis for each business question.
Borough File: Contains the dataset used in the project.

**Conclusion**
This project provides valuable insights that can inform decision-making and improve fire prevention and response strategies in Kingston Upon Thames. Explore the code and analysis to see how data mining techniques are applied to real-world problems.
